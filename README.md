**FLAME Senior Capstone Project**

Participated in a team of 12 to model, design, build, and test a proof of concept semi-autonomous sUAS for fire mitigation efforts. The sUAS shall be capabile of autonomous take-off, landing, and flight, while allowing for human-in-the-loop control to deploy the payload. Three seperate 5 pound payload must be deployed on three seperate target locations with an accuracy of +/- 1 meter within 20 minutes.

**Code:**  
Vibrational Analysis - Analysis of flight vibration data for determining problems and determining solutions  
Power Analysis - Modeling of energy consumption for flight profile both with datasheet and thrust test models. Addition of flight data and comparison with models as well as analyzing of model assumptions  
Flight Model - 6DOF dynamics and control model for modeling flight  
Thrust to Weight Analysis - Initial kinematics analysis for inputs to energy model
